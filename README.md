# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice in C

The code here is based on the code found in Mastering Algorithms with C by Kyle Loudon.

In here, you can find the code for the data structures, algorithms, and examples presented in the book. However, these were modified for the following reasons:

1. Brevity: The comments used in the books are not pleasant to look at.

2. Compactness: Some of the code can be written with less lines of code and still remain readable for expirienced C users.

3. Efficiency: Some of the code can be written more efficiently. 

4. Debugging: Some of the code might cause bugs, so I attempt to address what I can find here (and this will be noted in a comment whenever this happens)

5. Coding style: The code presented here uses a style that is more familiar in embedded applications.
